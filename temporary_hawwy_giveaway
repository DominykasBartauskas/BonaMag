# :loudspeaker: Hawwy's Giveaway :loudspeaker:

## Calling all new players and beginners of Dofus in general!

Are you a beginner in the world of Dofus? Want to boost your adventure with some amazing mounts? This is your chance to win fantastic prizes to help you on your journey!
### :gift: Prizes:
- Golden Rhineetle (1 AP, 150 Vitality)
- Almond and Emerald DT (1000 Initiative, 300 Vitality, 8% Critical)
- Emerald and Turqoise DT (300 Vitality, 8% Critical, 60 Prospecting)
- Emerald and Orchid DT (300 Vitality, 70 Inteligence, 8% Critical)
### :bookmark: Rules and entry instructions:
- To qualify for the giveaway, you have to be a newer player (i.e. not 200, not Opti, not rich). I guess you get the idea :wink: 
- Have to be active in one of our communities: :BONA: Bona Fide or :MAG: Magnum Opus.
To enter, simply choose the giveaway with the mount that you'd love to win and enter. 
Multiple entries are allowed, but only 1 mount will be given away per person, meaning that if you win 2 giveaways, you can choose which one you want more and the other will be given away after a secondary roll with this helpful tool, called [Roll a Die](https://rolladie.net/).

Best of luck to everyone! **May the Odds Be Ever in Your Favor**. :catflower:
